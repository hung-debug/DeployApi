It includes sample endpoints, mock data, and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to facilitate testing and development of frontend e-commerce features.

## Key Features:
* Endpoints for products, users, orders, and cart management.
* Mock Data to simulate real-world e-commerce scenarios.
* Ease of Integration for frontend projects needing an API during development.
* No Backend Setup required â€” ideal for testing and prototyping.
